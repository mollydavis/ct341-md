          <h2>BharatPe founder asks for the removal of CEO from board</h2>
          <p>
            BharatPe co-founder and managing director Ashneer Grover has asked
            the board for the removal of chief executive Suhail Sameer from the
            board in the latest of a series of remarkable turn of events at the
            Tiger Global-backed Indian fintech startup.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grover, who is subject to an ongoing investigation whose preliminary
            finding has suggested fraud, wrote in a letter to board members on
            Wednesday for the removal of Sameer from the board, though he did
            not offer an explanation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I, now, in exercise of the power vested in me by Clause 3.7 of the
            SHA and Clause 91.7 of the AoA do hereby withdraw, my nomination of
            Suhail Sameer as a Director nominated by me to the Board of
            Directors of the Company.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “In light thereof, I, Ashneer Grover request the Board of Directors
            of the Company to complete the necessary processes to record the
            cessation of the Directorship of Suhail Sameer as a Director of the
            Company,” the letter reads, the contents of which was reviewed by
            TechCrunch.
